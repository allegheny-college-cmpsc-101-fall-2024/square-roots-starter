# Square Root Computation

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the TODO markers inside of this file and
either remove or rewrite the prompts. When you are finished with this reflection
it should contain professional writing that is suitable for publishing. That
includes removing this paragraph!

## Add Your Name Here

## 1. Program Output

TODO: run your code using the `exhaustive` and `efficient` algorithms
on the same input. Copy in the output in fenced code blocks. It is essential
to use the same input for both algorithms; this allows you to compare your
results directly and understand which algorithm is more efficient.

TODO: Make an H3 heading for **each** command you used that identifies what
each command uniquely demonstrates compared to the others.

## 2. Performance Analysis

TODO: Provide paragraph(s) that state which algorithm is fastest. Please make
sure that you reference your program output from above to explain the results.
If there are anomalies in your data sets produced by `squareroot` then make
sure that you explain them to the best of your ability, leveraging the content
in the course textbook and any online resources you want to reference.
Importantly, you must describe both (a) the trends in the data set and (b) why
those trends are evident.

## 3. Source Code

TODO: Describe in detail how the completed source code segments works for the
following:

- Describe a source code segment that performs profiling on `compute_square_root_exhaustive`
- Use a fenced code block to provide that requested source code
- Describe the declaration of the default value of the `square_root_tuple`
- Use a fenced code block to provide that requested source code

## 4. Professional Assessment

TODO: Answer the three questions below.

- What was the main difference you felt implementing this CLI vs. the CLI for Integer Squaring?
- What are your strengths and weaknesses in the area of writing good commit messages?
- What are your strengths and weaknesses in the area of write good source code comments?
